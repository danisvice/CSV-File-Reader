## Introduction

The CSV File Reader program is written in Rust and leverages the `csv` crate to read and display data from CSV files. This program simplifies the process of working with CSV data by providing an easy-to-use interface.

## How it Works

This program performs the following steps:

1. Accepts the path to a CSV file as an input argument (in this example, "./nba_players.csv").
2. Uses the `csv` crate to open and parse the CSV file.
3. Iterates through the CSV records.
4. Prints each record to the console.

## Usage

To use the CSV File Reader program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/csv-file-reader.git
   cd csv-file-reader
   ```

3. Build and run the program, providing the path to your CSV file as an argument:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   cargo run ./[file].csv
   ```

   This will execute the program and display the contents of the CSV file on the console.
